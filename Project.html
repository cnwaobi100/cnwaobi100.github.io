                <h3>Undergraduate School</h3>
                <p>I am an undergradute mechanical engineering major from Houston, Texas. During my time as an
                    undergraduate student at Texas A&M University, I have excelled in my classes and have learned much
                    more than what was expected of me. I have spent each semester taking my required classes in order to
                    graduate and have achieved a passing grade in all of them. With the help of my friends that I have
                    met along the way, I have truly received a genuine excitement to learn and improve not only my
                    grades, but myself. I believe that I have been blessed with one of the greatest opportunities to
                    succeed, the chance to attend Texas A&M University and perform well in the department of Mechanical
                    Engineering isn't something that everyone is given, which is why I am so grateful.

                <h3>Community Involvement</h3>
                <p>I believe that one of the most important and rewarding feelings in life is when you are given the
                    chance or opportunity to give back to someone or something that is in need of assistance. Giving
                    back to the community that I have been raised in or went to school in is something that I have
                    always found myself doing. From volunteering to tutor elementary and middle schoolers through my 4
                    years in high school, to volunteering to help patients at the hospital that my mom works at for an
                    entire summer, to being a part of a leadership and motivatin organization during my sophomore and
                    junior year at Texas A&M, volunteering and community involvement is something that is near and very
                    dear to my heart and to my overall character.

                <h3>Freetime</h3>
                <p>In my freetime, I enjoy learning more than I already know, developing myself to be more ogranized,
                    and challenging myself to go above and beyond my own ability. I love finding new passions and
                    learning interesting things that go beyond my major that I may find applicable in any setting. I
                    love discovering new music and sharing it with my friends while also listening to the
                    recommendations they send to me. I enjoy watching basketball and football and occasionally playing
                    volleyball or running around my apartment complex for exercise. Ulimately, I love writing about
                    moments in my life and appreciating the happy moments that I come across whether I am with my
                    friends or by myself.

    <!--- About Me-->
    <section class="about-me" id="about">
        <h2 class="section__title section__title--about">My One Wish</h2>
        <p class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--about">Live Life One Moment At A Time</p>

        <div class="about-me__body">
            <p>Throughout my life, I have realized that there are certain moments that occur that are truly beautiful
                and worth cherishing and sharing forever. There's always this question of, "If you could have any
                superpower in the world, which would you have and why?" and here is my answer to that question. While
                having the power to fly or to turn invisible may be cool, the one power I would want to have is the
                power to relive a moment in my life and experience that feeling once again.</p>

            <p>But why would I "waste" an opporunity on such a wish like that? Because those moments, those once in a
                lifetime opportunities to experience a new smile or laugh or genuine happy feeling in your heart, are
                the moments that make life worth living. Those are the moments that are like none before, but they
                come at the cost of only experiencing them once.
            </p>

            <p>The purpose of this website, portfolio, blog, whatever you want to call it, is to highlight those
                moments. Those moments where I cried the most, laughed the most, was angry the most, achieved the most,
                or was genuinely in love with life the most. Those moments will have a photo attached to them where you
                can click on the image and read about that specific event. It is meant to give my perspective and to
                hopefully spread the message to enjoy life one memory at a time and to fully immerse yourself in the
                moment, because it is the only chance you'll get.</p>
