        <p>Sophomores Leading and Motivating (SLAM) is a Student Leadership Organization (SLO) at Texas A&M University.
            It is one of four leadership organizations available for sophomores to apply and be apart of during their
            sophomore year at Texas A&M. This organization is focused on promoting inclusivity, supporting the
            Bryan/College Station community through acts of selfless service, and also helping sophomores find a home at
            Texas A&M University. With attending such a huge university, it can be hard for some people to find their
            place and make a group of friends to depend on, especially with the stress of school and life on their mind.
            But, with the help of this organization and many others like it, the transition to adjusting to the adult
            world is made a little bit easier.</p>
        <img src="images/sophslam.jpg" alt="Group Picture of SLAM 2018-2019">
        <p>Now, I may have said "with the help of this organization <strong>and many others like it</strong>", but in
            reality, there is no other organization like SLAM. SLAM has given me a true family at Texas A&M University.
            And as cliche as it may sound, I genuinely do mean it. I appreciate every single member of that organization
            as they have shaped me into becoming a stronger and more organized person. I have always had this vision of
            the kind of person I wanted to become, but I was always scared and lost when it came to taking the
            initiative in working to become that person. But with the help of the friends I made during my sophomore
            year and with the assistance of the directors who supported the organization from the upper levels, I felt
            more comfortable with the kind of person I wanted to become. It took a lot of time to really become
            comfortable with the vision I had for myself, but I truly feel like I am becoming that person more and more
            every day since joining SLAM. I feel as if I have broken out of the shell that I was so comfortable staying
            in and I'm now more involved in my community and aware of the many opportunities in this world. And I have
            SLAM to thank for opening my eyes to this amazing feeling and way of life.</b></p>
        <p>When I think back to the end of my sophomore year, when I was preparing to apply for a director position in
            the organization, and when I was beginning to say goodbye to the memories that I made during my time as a
            general member in SLAM, there is one quote that I read that continues to stick with me to this day.<br>
            <center>"Gratitude for the context which I cannot exist without."</center>
