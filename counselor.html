        <p>As one of the selected Directors of Social Affairs for SLAM, I knew that I had the chance and
            opportunity to serve my community in College Station while also developing my own leadership skills. As a
            sophomore, I was mentored and developed under a great set of staff members who truly allowed for me to open
            up as a sophomore and become the person I always strived to be. As a junior, who was fortunate enough to be
            selected as a staff member out of many members applying for the position, I knew that I had a lot to prove.
            I knew that I had some sort of expectation and shoe that I had to fill and I knew that there was going to be
            an enourmous commitment to this role. This added pressure to my junior year, but as I like to say, pressure
            can either burst pipes or make diamonds. </p>

        <p>At first, it was difficult accepting this position and adjusting to the role. But as time went on and as the
            year progressed, I learned to adapt to this new envrionment and become one of the most impactful leaders in
            the organization. A lot of sophomores would depend on me for advice regarding their year or any personal
            matters, which I loved because it felt so rewarding giving back and being there for them as my staff members
            were there for me as a sophomore. The year ended up being a huge success. So many amazing leaders were
            developed and the sophomores gave nothing but endless praise and thanks for impacting their sophomore year
            in such a great way. This was accomplished due to our staff team's commitment to success. We knew that there
            was pressure on us to be great and we executed the year in such an amazing manner. We were patient,
            impactful, and committed. We knew how to work as a team and we quickly adapted to the environment we were
            placed in. This allowed for us to not only impact the lives of the sophomores, but our lives were changed as
            well. This leadership role not only changed my junior year, but it changed my life. I now know that I have
            impacted someone's life, even if it's just one person due to this year on the director team for SLAM. And
            that feeling alone is truly so rewarding.</p>
